# Capstone Project 1

This is the first capstone project completed as part of the Springboard Data Science Career Track

In this project we will explore the relationship between various attributes of a taxi ride, and the amount of tips that are given.  Do faster drivers get more tips?  Is the average tip higher during the weekend?  Maybe people tip more when it's raining.  These are some of the questions we will be exploring as we try to create a model to predict the amount of tips that a taxi ride receives.

The data is sourced from the following:

2016 Taxi Cab Data for NYC

2016 Hourly Weather Data in NYC

### Data Wrangling

Since there is a lot of data and some hardware limitations, the data was merged and sampled in steps before the cleaning process.  Notebooks are included in the Data_Wrangling folder.

### Data Analysis

Exploratory and statistical analysis was performed to look at interesting patterns and relationships within the data.  Jupyter notebook is included in the Notebooks folder.

### Machine Learning

Use supervised learning techniques to build a model that can predict the tip amount.  Jupyter notebook is included in the Notebooks folder.
